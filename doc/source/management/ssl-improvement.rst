SSL Improvements
================================================================================

|Percona Server| enables transmitting data in the encrypted form by using the
TLSv1.2 protocol. 


.. rubric:: Implemented Using |openssl|

|Percona Server| binaries link with the |openssl| library to implement the
support of TLS protocols. |Percona Server| supports |openssl| version 1.1.

|Percona Server| binaries do not link with the |yassl.def| as |MySQL| Community
Edition does. The |yassl| library only supports TSLv1.0 and TSL1.1 protocols
which are less secure than TLSv1.2. You may still link with |yassl| when
building |Percona Server| from source.

As part of its implementation, |Percona Server| offers correct diagnostic
messages in cases like ciphers on the client and the server mismatching, 
the required TLS version not enabled, and so on. For more information, see
`#75311 Error for SSL cipher is unhelpful
<https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=75311>`_.

.. important::

   As |Percona Server| does not use |yassl|, |yassl| security advisories are not
   applicable to |Percona Server|. System administrators should track the
   security advisories relevant to |openssl| and upgrade their operating system
   promptly.

       `#75311 Error for SSL cipher is unhelpful <https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=75311>`_

By default, |Percona Server| passes elliptic curve crypto-based
ciphers to OpenSSL, such as ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256.

.. note:: 

   Although documented as supported, elliptic curve crypto-based ciphers do not work with |MySQL|.

.. _percona-server.management.ssl.multi-domain-certificate:

Multi-Domain Certificates
================================================================================
      
|Percona Server| supports multi-domain certificates (:abbr:`SAN (Subject
Alternative Name)`). This feature is useful to help manage the storage better,
for building high availability clusters, or as part of a backup solution.
